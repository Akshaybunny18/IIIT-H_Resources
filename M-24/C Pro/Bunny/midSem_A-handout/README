# README for MidSem Lab Exam

## Overview

This document outlines the MidSem Lab Exam, consisting of three programming problems designed to test your algorithmic skills and understanding of C programming. Each problem includes a detailed description, input/output formats, constraints, and sample test cases.

## Problems

### Problem 1: Pingala Storing Names

**Description**:  
Create a C program that allows the Pingala server to store a fixed number of names in an array. The program should support the following operations:
- Add a name.
- Display all names.
- Exit the program.

**Constraints**:
- Maximum number of names: **10**
- Maximum length of each name: **30 characters**
- Use dynamic memory allocation for storing names.

**Input Format**:
- `1` to add a name.
- `2` to display all names.
- `0` to exit the program.

**Sample Input 1**:
```
1
Alice
1
Bob
2
0
```

**Sample Output 1**:
```
Names:
Alice
Bob
```

**Sample Input 2**:
```
1
Alice
1
Bob
1
Charlie
1
David
1
Eve
1
Frank
1
Grace
1
Hannah
1
Ivy
1
Jack
1
Kate
2
0
```

**Sample Output 2**:
```
Cannot add more names. Maximum limit reached.
Names:
Alice
Bob
Charlie
David
Eve
Frank
Grace
Hannah
Ivy
Jack
```

**Additional Notes**:
Ensure to handle memory allocation properly and free any allocated memory before exiting the program to avoid memory leaks. If you encounter a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error, check the given conditions and feel free to modify your approach.

### Problem 2: Automated Robot Sorting

**Description**:  
Valera, a little robot, has studied sorting algorithms. He wrote a program that sorts an array of `n` integers in non-decreasing order. However, he might have made a mistake. You need to provide a counter-example that demonstrates the failure of his sorting algorithm. If no counter-example exists for the given value of `n`, print `-1`.

**Input Format**:
- A single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the size of the array.

**Output Format**:
- Print `n` space-separated integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) that serve as a counter-example. If impossible, print `-1`.

**Examples**:
- **Sample Input 1**:
```
1
```
- **Sample Output 1**:
```
-1
```
- **Sample Input 2**:
```
3
```
- **Sample Output 2**:
```
3 2 1
```

### Problem 3: Alien Buffet Feast

**Description**:  
After a space mission, astronaut Yash is invited to an alien buffet with various dishes arranged in a straight line. Each dish provides a different level of satisfaction. Yash can only take consecutive dishes. Your task is to help Yash maximize his total satisfaction by selecting a consecutive subarray of dishes.

**Input**:
- The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of dishes.
- The second line contains `n` integers representing the happiness value of each dish.

**Output**:
- A single integer representing the maximum happiness Yash can achieve by selecting consecutive dishes.

**Constraints**:
- \( 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 \)
- \( -1000 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1000 \)

**Examples**:
- **Input 1**:
```
5
-1 -2 3 -1 -2
```
- **Output 1**:
```
3
```
- **Input 2**:
```
5
1 2 3 -2 3
```
- **Output 2**:
```
7
```
